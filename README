NAME
    Perinci::BashComplete - Bash completion routines for function & function
    argument over Riap

VERSION
    version 0.28

SYNOPSIS
     # require'd by Sub::Spec::CmdLine when bash completion is enabled

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functionality for doing bash completion. It is
    meant to be used by Sub::Spec::CmdLine, but nevertheless some routines
    are reusable outside it.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.

BUGS/LIMITATIONS/TODOS
    Due to parsing limitation (invokes subshell), can't complete unclosed
    quotes, e.g.

     foo "bar <tab>

    while shell function can complete this because they are provided
    COMP_WORDS and COMP_CWORD by bash.
